  <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p> I am a full-stack developer located in the Philadelphia Area. I recently decided to change careers from sales into web-development and have since found a passion for solving all the challenges that computer programming presents. 
    I currently live in Fishtown with my fiance√©, our two cats and our dog. I look forward to the next steps in my career and would love to discuss any questions you may have on my projects or my site overall. Feel free to call or email me with any questions. Thanks! </p>
